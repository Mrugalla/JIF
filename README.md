# JIF
a VST3 Plugin (Windows, 64bit), that loops a GIF to the tempo of your beat.

Features:
- resizable window
- controls window fades out when no mouse over anymore (enjoy clean GIF)
- change the range of images to loop (left clicks for start, right clicks for end)
- loop times: 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4 bars
- change the phase of the loop (start image)
- link to my development discord (feature requests, bug reports, getting informed about updates)
- save gif as wavetables that you can import in serum / vital etc.
- link to this github (also for updates)
- link to paypal (if you're cool) ;)

Known issues:
- In FL using the phase parameter before loading a gif can apparently show a questionable error message. it doesn't seem to break things but should be avoided until fixed
- it should be noted that the graphics are glitchy in the menu. don't let that discourage you. they get back to normal once the mouse gets off the window anyway
